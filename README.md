### 🔭 Currently building
- 🚜 **lufarming** – An AI-powered farm management platform to help smallholder farmers collaborate, manage operations, and access funding by building trust with lenders through data and technology.
- 🌞 Off-grid **solar-powered infrastructure** for internet and irrigation in rural Namibia.
- 📱 **Offline-first mobile apps** using React Native and NestJS for environments with unstable connectivity.
